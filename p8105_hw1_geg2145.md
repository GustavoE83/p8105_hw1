# Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
weather = early_january_weather
```

This dataset has hourly meterological data for the month of January 2013
for three airports: La Guardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark Liberty. In
total, this dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. The `origin` variable
tells us the weather station that made the recording, although for this
subset, all recordings are made from “EWR” (Newark). We also have the
recorded `temperature` and `relative humidity`, along with the `time`
the recording was made (date and hour). The mean temperature across all
the recordings available is 39.582 degrees Fahrenheit.
