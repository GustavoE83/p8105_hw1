# Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
weather = early_january_weather
```

This dataset has hourly meterological data for the month of January 2013
for three airports: La Guardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark Liberty. In
total, this dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. The `origin` variable
tells us the weather station that made the recording, although for this
subset, all recordings are made from “EWR” (Newark). We also have the
recorded `temperature` and `relative humidity`, along with the `time`
the recording was made (date and hour). The mean temperature across all
the recordings available is 39.582 degrees Fahrenheit.

``` r
ggplot(weather) + 
  geom_point(aes(x= time_hour, y = temp, col= humid)) + 
  labs(x="Time", y="Temperature (in F)", 
       col="Relative Humidity", 
       title="January got warmer and more humid as time went on")
```

```

In the above scatterplot, we see `time` in the x-axis and `temperature`
in the y axis. Although the temperature fluctuates throughout the day
(as we go from day to night, and back to day), we see that overall,
temperature is trending upwards as time goes on. We also see our points
colored by their `relative humidity`, and see most dark points in
earlier dates, with most of the lighter ones in later dates. This
indicates that generally, the days got more humid as January went along.

# Problem 2

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  
  normal = rnorm(10),
  positive = normal > 0,
  characters = sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 10, replace = T),
  factors = factor(characters)
  
)
```

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(normal) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] -0.1743492

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(positive) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(characters) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(factors) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We are able to get the mean of the 10 numbers from a standard Normal
distribution (-0.1743492), which works as we expect it to.

For the `positive` variable, we have a logical vector and the `mean`
function treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. Using this, we get the
mean.

For the character and factor variables, the `mean` function does not
work (since they aren’t numbers), so we get `NA`.

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(positive) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(characters) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
p2_df %>%
  pull(factors) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 2.2

When converting the vectors to numerical, `logical` values switch to 0’s
and 1’s (as described before), `character` values change to NA’s, and
`factor` values switch to a number representing their level, with lowest
value assigned to the first level in alphabetical order (“a” was mapped
to 1, “b” was mapped to 2 and “c” was mapped to 3). Interestingly,
taking the mean of the “factor” vector works now even though it wasn’t
working before.
